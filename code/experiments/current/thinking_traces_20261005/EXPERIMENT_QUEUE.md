# Experiment queue: what is running, queued, held and done

This is the single tracking list for the thinking-traces runs. Update it whenever a job starts, finishes or
changes; Git keeps the history. All paths are under `/scratch/cowifornia/nd-rl/think/runs/` and all times are PDT.

**Matched budget.** One EI round is 5,000 × 32 = 160k attempts, and 39 GRPO iterations are 256 × 16 × 39 =
160k. So EI r1 ↔ GRPO it39 and EI r2 ↔ GRPO it78.

## Running (updated 2026-10-09, 11:45 am PDT)

**The only question:** uplift of the thinking-trace models over the EI no-think baseline at matched inference
compute. Results so far: [THINKING_UPLIFT.md](THINKING_UPLIFT.md).

| job | GPUs | ETA | why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Seed-2 pair: Stage 1 (S1g3 / T0S, seed 2), then EI r1 (rl_hard12), r2 (hard712 a), r3 (hard712 b); matched-compute reads after r2 and r3 on 13–20 and textbook72 | 0, 1 train; 2, 3 r2 reads | ~8–9 pm PDT | Seeds 0 and 1 disagree at high compute (16k tokens: seed 0 −1.6 / −7.1, seed 1 +7.6 / +8.2); a third seed decides which is typical. Leon approved. |

## Proposed (not run; waiting for Leon, 30-min auto-run rule applies)

From [RL_RESULTS.md](RL_RESULTS.md#proposals-not-run-need-leons-call):
1. **Second seeds of the graded arm and of one budget + token cost.** About 3 GPU-h each, plus 1.5 GPU-h of evals.
   Seed spread is currently as large as the differences between variants.
2. **Restart the seed-0 effort run from it39**, once with the same settings and once at half the learning rate,
   to see whether the it48 clip-low spike and the 13–20 drop recur.

## Done 2026-10-07 (write-up: [RL_RESULTS.md](RL_RESULTS.md); tables: [matched_eval/final_tables.md](matched_eval/final_tables.md))

- **Matched EI vs GRPO** (r1/r2 vs it39/it78, both arms, seed 0) on hard12_test, textbook72 and t1320 (986 valid
  items).
- **Seed-1 GRPO pair**, plus the seed-1 13–20 learning curve (it10–75).
- **Single-budget thinking GRPO** (`grpo_T1v1_b256`) and the token-cost variant (`grpo_T1v1_b256_lp02`), both to
  it78.
- **Budget forcing (s1-style).** Forcing any minimum think length lowers accuracy.
- **Locating the 13–20 drop in the seed-0 effort run.** The gain is gone by it49 and never recovers.
- **Graded-length traces** (`graded_traces/`), Stage-1 T1v1g4, and GRPO from it, plain and with LCPO. All evals
  are done.
- **LCPO reward** implemented (`grpo.py`, 4608e60).
- **Process fix:** eval queues now count an eval as done only when every budget's rows file exists
  (`followup_20261007/lib.sh` `evdone`). `summary.json` is rewritten after each budget, so it is not enough.

## Held

- **hard12r** (≤12-line targets that stay hard after RL). Pilot done, 0.3 GPU-h; see
  [pools/hard12r/README.md](pools/hard12r/README.md).
  - RL'd no-think GRPO (it35) solves 7–8 of 8 on 88.5% of fresh ≤12-line generator candidates, and on 85.9%
    of hard12's spare in-band targets. Only 2.7% of fresh candidates land at 1–2 of 8.
  - Structural features barely move this (3–9% at ≤2/8 across goal types, depth and length).
  - So ≤12-line headroom after RL is close to exhausted. Any test split must be an unfiltered random sample.
- **A harder pool selected by model-independent features.** Revisit on the same condition.
- **EI with smaller rounds** (k 8 per target, 40k attempts per round, a fine-tune after each). This gives a
  checkpoint every 10 GRPO iterations, so EI and GRPO can be compared below one full round. Decide after the
  r1 vs it39 evals: if EI is already near ceiling at r1, the finer curve adds little. Cost: about 4 h no-think
  and 6 h thinking, on two GPUs.

## Done (details in the linked notes)

- Stage 1 (4 arms × 3 seeds), goal-stack and filler controls, and the hard12 seed control: see
  [STAGE1_STATS.md](STAGE1_STATS.md) and [`stage1_stats/`](stage1_stats/).
- Adaptivity across RL checkpoints: [ADAPTIVITY.md](ADAPTIVITY.md).
- GRPO scoring bug (fixed in 7b082b7) and overlong-masking drift: [GRPO_COLLAPSE_AUDIT.md](GRPO_COLLAPSE_AUDIT.md).
- EI on hard12: both arms stopped on 2026-10-07 at Leon's call (stop early). Checkpoints r1–r4 are kept (r5 for
  no-think).
- The 21–30-line sealed test set: [test_21_30/README.md](test_21_30/README.md).
